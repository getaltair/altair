## Risk Mitigation

Potential issues and how to handle them.

### Technical Risks

**PowerSync integration complexity**

- Risk: Takes longer than expected
- Mitigation: Start with basic sync, iterate
- Fallback: Ship without sync first, add later

**Performance at scale**

- Risk: Slow with 1000+ tasks/pages
- Mitigation: Profile early, optimize incrementally
- Fallback: Pagination, virtual scrolling

**AI API costs**

- Risk: OpenAI/Anthropic bills too high
- Mitigation: Implement rate limiting, caching
- Fallback: Ollama (free, local) as default

### Schedule Risks

**Scope creep**

- Risk: Adding too many features
- Mitigation: Stick to MVP checklists
- Strategy: "One thing well" philosophy

**Dogfooding delays**

- Risk: Don't actively use Guidance
- Mitigation: Force switch, no alternatives
- Accountability: Public dogfooding commitment

**Scope creep**

- Risk: Adding too many features delays releases
- Mitigation: One app at a time, celebrate milestones
- Strategy: Ship early, ship often

### Adoption Risks

**Too complex for users**

- Risk: Features overwhelm new users
- Mitigation: Onboarding flow, progressive disclosure
- Strategy: Start simple, unlock features gradually

**Not ADHD-friendly enough**

- Risk: Doesn't actually help ADHD users
- Mitigation: User testing with ADHD community
- Strategy: Discord feedback, iterate based on needs
