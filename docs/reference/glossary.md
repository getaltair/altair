# Glossary

## Purpose

Canonical definitions for terms used throughout Altair documentation and codebase. When in doubt
about what something means, check here.

## Guidance Module

### Quest

A focused unit of work designed to be completed in a single session. The core building block of the
Guidance module. Quests have an energy cost (1-5) and enforce a WIP limit of one active Quest at a
time.

### Epic

A large goal composed of multiple Quests. Epics provide context and motivation but are not directly
worked on. An Epic is complete when all its Quests are complete.

### Checkpoint

An optional sub-step within a Quest. Used to break down complex Quests into trackable pieces.
Completing all Checkpoints does not auto-complete the Quest.

### Energy Budget

A daily allocation of "energy points" representing cognitive capacity. Default is 5 points per day.
Completing a Quest deducts its energy cost from the budget. Energy is a soft limit—you can exceed it
with a warning.

### Energy Cost

A 1-5 rating of how much cognitive effort a Quest requires. 1 = trivial task, 5 = deeply demanding
work. Used for daily planning and avoiding overcommitment.

### WIP Limit

Work-in-progress limit. Altair enforces WIP=1 for Quests, meaning only one Quest can be active at a
time. This is a core ADHD-friendly constraint to prevent context switching.

### Backlog

The pool of Quests not yet started. Quests begin in backlog status and move to active when started.

### Focus Mode

A distraction-reduced view showing only the active Quest and its Checkpoints. Hides navigation and
other modules to minimize cognitive load.

## Knowledge Module

### Note

A unit of knowledge stored as Markdown text. Notes can link to other Notes, have tags, and include
attachments. The atomic unit of the Knowledge module.

### Wiki-Link

A link between Notes using double-bracket syntax: `[[Note Title]]`. Parsed from Note content to
build the knowledge graph.

### Backlink

An incoming link—a Note that links to the current Note. Displayed in the Note detail view to show
"what references this?"

### Knowledge Graph

The network of Notes and their links. Visualized as nodes (Notes) and edges (links). Enables
discovery of related concepts.

### Folder

A hierarchical container for organizing Notes. Folders can be nested. Note titles must be unique
within a folder.

### Tag

A flat label applied to Notes for categorization. Tags have no hierarchy. A Note can have multiple
tags.

### Attachment

A file associated with a Note. Stored in the app data directory and referenced by the Note. Supports
images, PDFs, and other file types.

### Embedding

A vector representation of a Note's content, generated by an AI model. Used for semantic
search—finding Notes by meaning rather than keywords.

### Semantic Search

Finding Notes based on meaning similarity rather than exact text match. Uses embeddings and vector
similarity (cosine distance).

## Tracking Module

### Item

A physical object being tracked in inventory. Items have a name, quantity, optional location, and
custom fields. The core entity of the Tracking module.

### Location

A fixed physical place where Items are stored (e.g., "Garage", "Kitchen Drawer"). Locations can be
hierarchical.

### Container

A movable storage unit that holds Items (e.g., "Toolbox", "Moving Box"). Containers have their own
Location and can be nested.

### Custom Field

A user-defined attribute on an Item. Supports multiple types: text, number, date, boolean, URL,
enum. Defined per-Item or via Templates.

### Item Template

A predefined schema for a category of Items (e.g., "Book", "Medication"). Templates define which
Custom Fields are available and their types.

### Quantity

The count of an Item in inventory. Zero quantity means "out of stock" not deleted. Quantity changes
can trigger events (e.g., low-stock warnings).

## Cross-Module Concepts

### Module

One of the three main functional areas: Guidance (task management), Knowledge (notes/PKM), Tracking
(inventory). Modules are loosely coupled via the Event Bus.

### Cross-Reference

A link between entities in different modules. Examples: Quest references a Note, Note mentions an
Item. Enables integrated workflows.

### Event Bus

The internal publish/subscribe system for inter-module communication. Modules publish events after
actions; other modules subscribe and react.

### Event

A notification that something happened (e.g., `quest_completed`, `note_updated`). Events have a type
and payload. Used for loose coupling between modules.

## Technical Terms

### ULID

Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier. The ID format used for all entities. 26
characters, sortable by creation time, locally generated.

### SurrealDB

The embedded database used for persistence. Supports documents, graphs, full-text search, and vector
search in a single system.

### SurrealKV

The storage engine used by SurrealDB in Altair. A key-value store optimized for embedded use.

### Tauri

The desktop application framework. Provides a Rust backend with a WebView frontend, enabling native
performance with web technologies.

### IPC

Inter-Process Communication. The bridge between the Svelte frontend and Rust backend in Tauri.
Commands are invoked from frontend and executed in backend.

### Soft Delete

Marking a record as deleted without removing it from the database. Soft-deleted records are hidden
from normal views but can be restored. Hard delete occurs after a retention period.

### Migration

A versioned change to the database schema. Migrations run on app startup to evolve the data
structure as Altair develops.

## ADHD-Specific Terms

### Decision Fatigue

Mental exhaustion from making too many choices. Altair mitigates this with sensible defaults, WIP
limits, and progressive disclosure.

### Context Switching

The cognitive cost of shifting attention between tasks. Altair's WIP=1 limit prevents having
multiple active Quests to switch between.

### Hyperfocus

A state of intense concentration on a single task. Focus Mode supports hyperfocus by removing
distractions from the interface.

### Working Memory

Short-term memory used for active tasks. Limited capacity (often cited as 4±1 items). Altair's
Checkpoint feature offloads working memory to the system.

### Time Blindness

Difficulty perceiving the passage of time. Energy budgets help by framing capacity in terms of
effort units rather than hours.

### Analysis Paralysis

Inability to act due to overthinking options. Altair's constraints (WIP=1, energy budget) reduce
options and make action easier.

### Externalization

Moving information from your head to an external system. Core principle of Altair—capture everything
in Quests, Notes, and Items so your brain doesn't have to hold it.
